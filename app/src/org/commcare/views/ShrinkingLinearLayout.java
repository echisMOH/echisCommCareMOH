/**
 * A shrinking linear layout is capable of denoting one child view which can change its size
 * if the full space is not needed.
 *
 * Normally a linear layout requires either fully laying out (IE: Pre-determined static sizes or
 * ratios) all of its children _or_ accepting that if the linear layout grows larger than its parent
 * some views will be cut off.
 *
 * When designing a shrinking layout, the view can be laid out fully "expanded" (IE: All of the
 * child views are the largest they will ever be), then one view can be chosen to shrink to its
 * "natural" width if it doesn't need the full space. This allows for things like text fields with
 * an element next to the text that can grow horizontally _until_ running into the fully "expanded"
 * layout.
 *
 * Limitations:
 * This layout is incrementally slower than a traditional linear layout.
 * The view will currently only shrink horizontally

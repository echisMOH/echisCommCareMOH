/**
 * A delayed blocking action will be executed at most one time after some fixed period of delay.
 *
 * Each action has an associated tag. This tag should always represent the same action, and the
 * caller should be indifferent as to whether their delayed action runnable fires, or whether
 * another action fires at another time. If the associated manager receives multiple actions in
 * sequence it will invalidate the old actions in order, assuming that the request for a delay
 * has restarted
 *
 * An example of an implementing action is a screen update that should fire after a user sets the
 * value of some interactive widget. Setting a short delay (200ms or so) can ensure that as the user
 * interacts with a value that can change rapidly (like a slider) that the value has a chance to
 * "settle" before processing, rather than firing a barrage of value update events.
 *
 * Delayed actions time out after a fixed period
